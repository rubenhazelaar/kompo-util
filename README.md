# Kompo Util

This repository contains utility functions which are provided for ease-of-use or syntactic sugar, more or less specific for the Kompo library.

## Kompo

Kompo is a react js like library which tries to stay as simple as possible. No virtual DOM or JSX. 
Kompo loves the DOM & makes it possible to build interfaces through components.
